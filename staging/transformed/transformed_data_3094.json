We have received a National Science Foundation SBIR grant to do research on computer vision for understanding plant geometry. This is a challenging problem in farm fields where many plants can overlap and occlude one another. We\u2019re looking for a remote software developer to help with building and running the software involved in this research. The grant period is 9 months, but if the project goes well there is a good chance that the work will continue after that.</p><p><br></p><p>Requirements:</p><ul><li>experience with C++</li><li>experience with Python</li><li>experience with image processing and/or computer vision algorithms</li><li>experience with PyTorch and/or TensorFlow</li><li>based in US</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Optional:</p><ul><li>experience with developing and running machine learning models on AWS</li><li>experience with OpenCV</li></ul><p><br></p><p>To apply: please send a resume along with a link to some C++ and/or Python code that you have written.</p><p><br></p><p>Compensation: $117k/year (for 9 months) plus health insurance</p>",
