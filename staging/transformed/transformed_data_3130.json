We guess you probably do since you\u2019re looking at a Machine Learning job ad. Payroll data \u2026 super dry stuff, huh? Well, truth is, only a subset of the population uses online shopping, or orders food deliveries, or binges TV series. But everyone, EVERYONE!, who gets paid has payroll data. More of it every month, every day, every hour. Payroll has more or less done the same thing since it was the first ever automated business application built in the 1950s. But we believe that using modern Machine Learning techniques, we can transform the way that Payroll is processed.
