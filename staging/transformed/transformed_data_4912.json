        "description": "<p><strong>About Cheetah</strong> </p><p><strong><br></strong> </p><p>Restaurants and small businesses account for hundreds of billions of dollars in annual </p><p>purchasing, yet most of it happens offline. From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of joe to </p><p>museum-quality lattes (and yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long paper trail and a </p><p>series of truck deliveries. </p><p><br> </p><p>With a rapidly growing market presence, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily workflow of </p><p>hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah\u2019s services, they manage </p><p>millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah eliminates the burden of costly sales </p><p>reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers.
