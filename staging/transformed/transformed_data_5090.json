We are here to be a part of this change. Every reinvention begins with a blank sheet of paper, and a willingness to reason from first principles.</p><p>This is where Prediction Machine enters the picture. Our first move in this direction was a global search for talent. To paraphrase Elon Musk, we are building the team that will build the solution.</p><p><br></p><p>Our goal is to ship investment strategies that outperform because they leverage unusual data, or usual data in an unusual way, and rely on massive computational abilities to make plausible, sample-efficient estimates.</p><p><br></p><p>See more about us at https://www.predmachine.com</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>As a quant or a data scientist, you are expected to bring strong experience in building and deploying scalable machine learning algorithms. You will work with a team of motivated individuals on building trading algorithms and strategies, while being responsible for monitoring the health of your deployed algorithms.
