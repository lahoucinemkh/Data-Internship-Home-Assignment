This as opposed to the traditional one-time, dipstick</p><p>the methodology of a test that hurriedly bundles the child into a slot, that in-turn \u2018declares\u2019 the child to be fit for a career in a specific area or a particular set of courses that would perhaps get him somewhere. At the core of our system is a lot of data \u2013 both structured and unstructured. We have books and questions and web resources and student reports that drive all our machine learning algorithms. Our goal is to not only figure out how a child is coping but also figure out how to help him by presenting relevant information and questions to him in topics that he is struggling to learn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Required Skillsets:</u></strong></p><p>\u2022 Wisdom to know when to hustle and when to be calm and dig deep.
