        "description": "<strong>The Role<br><br></strong>Tesla\u2019s Vehicle Engineering team is currently seeking a software engineer to focus on improving our in-house manufacturing and supply chain computer vision platform. As well, this role will be able to contribute to many of our other purpose-built applications that automate and improve the process of designing, building, and delivering our products, globally.<br><br>Tesla\u2019s Vehicle Engineering team, in general, owns the centralized technical aspects of our multi-continent Gigafactory network and product line. The systems we work on include Tesla\u2019s most important programs, such as Plaid, Cybertruck, cell production and new factories. The software team is responsible for making these systems and operations every bit as intelligent and dynamic as the products themselves.<br><br>As a software engineer on the Vehicle Engineering team, you will be in a product ownership role, leveraging whatever tech you feel fits best, (e.g., gRPC, Kafka, Lambda\u2019s, containerized deployments running in AWS and Kubernetes On-Prem) to re-imagine how global Gigafactory network should operate. Knowledge of networking, computer architecture, and computer science fundamentals, like data structures and algorithms, working with HMI/PLCs and similar IOT devices are highly desired traits. The ideal candidates will carry the product from conception all the way through customer delivery and refactoring, embracing issues that inevitably arise in complex industrial and scientific environments. The role will require the confidence to flex into all aspects of software engineering, as needed, to make the final product successful.<br><br><strong><u>Responsibilities<br></u></strong><ul><li>Build web services that make program managers, production associates, and forklift drivers orders of magnitude more efficient </li><li>Work with SCADA systems (e.g., Ignition from InductiveAutomation) to develop next generation material flow automations </li><li>Work closely with stakeholders pre and post development to maintain a closed loop while continuing to innovate on the product </li><li>Write simple code with clean interfaces ensuring scalability, portability, traceability (e.g., logging and monitoring), resiliency and performance </li><li>Demonstrate good DevOps practices </li><li>Lead whiteboarding, code reviews, and pair programming sessions </li><li>Maintain and improve existing applications as needed <br></li></ul><strong><u>Requirements<br></u></strong><ul><li>BS in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent industry experience </li><li>Deep understanding of machine-to-machine communication concepts, i.e., TCP/IP, websockets, and RPC </li><li>Understanding of when to use and how to set up message brokers, e.g., Kafka and AWS Kinesis </li><li>Ability to choose the right storage system, e.g., relational DBs (AWS RDS for Postgres, CockroachDB on Kubernetes), caches (Redis, Elastic Search), S3 (public cloud and private versions), time-series DBs (InfluxDB), etc., based on application need </li><li>Experience with production systems and orchestration in AWS or a private cloud, especially with Kubernetes, using tools like Terraform, Ansible, ArgoCD, Docker, Prometheus, or similar. </li><li>Experience with Go and/or Python programming languages </li><li>Familiarity with Javascript and basic UI knowledge </li><li>Experience working with HMI\u2019s/PLC\u2019s and SCADA systems (nice-to-have) </li><li>Leadership experience in an engineering domain (nice-to-have) <br></li></ul><em>Employee Benefits <br></em><ul><li>As a full time Tesla employee you will receive full benefits from day 1 for you and your dependents. </li><li>Kaiser and UnitedHealthcare PPO and HSA plans (including infertility coverage)</li><li>3 medical plan choices with $0 paycheck contribution </li><li>Vision &amp; dental plans (including orthodontic coverage)</li><li>Company paid Life, AD&amp;D, short-term and long-term disability </li><li>401(k), Employee Stock Purchase Plans, and other financial benefits </li><li>Employee Assistance Program, Paid Time Off, and Paid Holidays</li><li>Back-up childcare and employee discounts</li></ul>",
